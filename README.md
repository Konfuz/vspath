# vspath
a pathfinder for vintagestory

Work in Progress. I do not consider it suitable for distribution yet and the code can get a lot cleaner but I'll put it
up for the interested audience.

## Usage
Import at least one datasource, `points_of_interest.tsv` from automaps local files, or
[translocators_lines.geojson](https://aurafurymap.ga/translocators_lines.geojson) from the [aurafury webmap](https://aurafurymap.ga/)

Refer to commandline documentation with `./vspath.py -h`


## Known Issues

* Performance at long-distances is poor and leads to suboptimal results
