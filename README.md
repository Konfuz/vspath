# vspath
a pathfinder for vintagestory

Work in Progress. I do not consider it suitable for distribution yet and the code can get a lot cleaner but I'll put it
up for the interested audience.

In particular I currently transform the launch-option based approach to a full-blown CLI Interface. 


## Usage

import <path to CampaignCartographer export>
route <from> <to>
type help for further info
